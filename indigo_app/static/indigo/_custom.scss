// other installations can provide their own SCSS by providing
// their own static/indigo/_custom.scss file which will be included automatically,
// after all other Indigo SCSS files

// This file is deliberately not included alongside the app.scss file, as SCSS imports
// always look in the directory containing the including file first.
