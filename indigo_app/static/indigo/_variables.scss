// other installations can override indigo SCSS variables by providing
// their own static/indigo/_variables.scss file which will be included automatically,
// after other Indigo variables are set, but before any styles are included.

// This file is deliberately not included alongside the app.scss file, as SCSS imports
// always look in the directory containing the including file first.
